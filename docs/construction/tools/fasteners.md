# Intro to Fasteners

Welcome to the tools section of the construction documentation! For the first part of this section we will be taking a look at fasteners. Fasteners are essential for locking in paramount pieces that allow the robot to maintain form. Each type of fastener comes in many forms, shapes and sizes; while we may not cover every one of them in detail, we hope that this documentation gives you a strong foundation with using construction tools.

### Screws
Little stripping of screws is acceptable. Scrap any type of stripped screws, nuts, or bolts.

### Bolts
Bolts are not used often.

### Locknuts

### Nuts
Only use the wrench to grip nuts and bolts.

### Washer
Washers should be used with screws, bolts, and nuts to prevent loosing and to distribute the weight between the washer and screws, bolts, or nuts over a larger area.

### Spacers
Spacers come in different sizes (1/8", 1/4", 2", etc.). Acetal Hex Spacers are used to maintain space between components.

### Locite(glue)
Locite is used to lock a screw in place. It has three different strengths. Blue is the lowest strength. Red is the medium strength. Green is the strongest strength.
