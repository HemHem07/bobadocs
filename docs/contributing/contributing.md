# Contributing

There are always going to be improvements, fixes, and updates that can be made to our documentation. It's up to team members to make these changes. Detailed in this section is how you can help with these efforts.

## Setup

The following contributing steps assume that you have basic knowledge of **Markdown**, **Python**, **Terminal**, and **Github**. See [Contributing Resources](contresources.md) for more details.

Although you can directly edit the Markdown file on Github (e.g. quick file changes), it is recommended to setup a proper development environment to work on the website. Auto-reload is supported to give a preview of your local changes before pushing to Github.

!!! tip
	If you are not familiar with python, editing via a **Docker Container** is also supported. However, it has not yet been setup for this repository. See [MkDocs-Material: Alternative Using Docker](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/#alternative-using-docker) for more information.
