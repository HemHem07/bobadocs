# Git and Github

git is a tool our software team uses to collaborate
<!-- somebody please add more description ;-; -->

## Installing git

[Instructions from the official git website.](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

## Using Github

If you don't already have one, create an account at https://github.com/.


## Github Practices

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing on Github for our team. These are guidelines, not hard rules.

- If writing test code, create a new branch or add onto another. **Do not use the master branch for testing.**
    - Edit the README with useful things (ie. Branch Descriptions)
- Write useful commit messages; Describe what changes you made. (<action\>, <changes\>) is a good format. For example,
`"add subsystems"` is good, [`"aaron didnt fucking push and the room is closing. im writing this as we are putting this into the car so this commit makes no sense"`](https://github.com/MillsRoboticsTeam253/Code2020/commit/1852ffd53b55373be62a71ae42dea6d1beb92bf7) is not good.
    - Keep commit messages in present-tense. ie: ~~"Added shooter PID""~~ should instad be `"Add shooter PID"`
