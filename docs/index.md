## Welcome

to the programming training document for Boba Bots 253. This document is updated for the FRC 2020 game [Infinite Recharge](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc/game-and-season).

We are moving at a significantly faster pace than engineering courses offered at the school, and it's okay to get stuck or not know something. The team veterans are here to help, please ask us questions!
