## Github Practices

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing on Github for our team. These are guidelines, not hard rules.

- If writing test code, create a new branch or add onto another. **Do not use the master branch for testing.**
    - Edit the README with useful things (ie. Branch Descriptions)
- Write useful commit messages; Describe what changes you made. (<action\>, <changes\>) is a good format. For example,
`"add subsystems"` is good, `"aaron didnt f*cking push and the room is closing. im writing this as we are putting this into the car so this commit makes no sense"` is not good.
    - Keep commit messages in present-tense. ie: ~~"Added shooter PID""~~ should instead be `"Add shooter PID"`
