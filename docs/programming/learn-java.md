Hi. Welcome to the Programming section of the BobaDocs!

Before you get started, let me just say this: We are moving at a significantly faster pace than any computer science course offered at the school, and it's okay to get stuck or not know something. 
The Programming team veterans are here to help, *please ask us questions*!
This is pretty difficult stuff, but I guarantee that it will be worth it and that we'll make it through together.

## Learning Java

**Java** is the programming language used by most FRC teams to program their robot. Other languages include C++ and Python.
For the sake of convenience, our team writes our robot code in Java.

If you are not yet proficient enough to pass the [AP Computer Science A exam](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a), you should take the Codecademy Java course found here: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java.

This course will walk you through the basics of Java and Object-Oriented Programming that you will need for FRC programming. It will take approximately three weeks, split up into the following sections:

Week 1:

- Hello World
- Variables and Data Types
- Object-Oriented Java

Week 2:

- Conditionals and Control Flow
- Arrays and ArrayLists
- Loops

Week 3:

- (Optional) String methods
- Inheritance and Polymorphism
- Debugging

!!! warning
    Do not do the "Pro" sections; they're not necessary and will slow you down.
