### Earthquakes:
    - If outside, do not go back indoors, and stay away from trees, streetlamps, and other tall structures
    - If indoors, take cover by hiding underneath the nearest sturdy table or any other object that can protect you from falling debris. (e.g. one of the lab/work tables)
        - Stop, Cover, and Hold On
    - Stay inside and under cover until the earthquake stops. It is extremely dangerous to try and run outside during an earthquake
    - Electricity may shut down or fire sprinklers may go off during an earthquake
    - After the earthquake stops, be sure to frequently check in on warnings via radio or news
    - Be wary, aftershocks may still continue after the initial quake
