### Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
All members of the Mills Robotics Team (mentors, leads, general members, etc.) are responsible for making sure that they and all other members are wearing proper protective equipment.

## Proper PPE Includes:
### Suitable Clothing
* When working or observing within fifty feet of a machine or inside the Makerspace, pants must be worn at all times
* When inside the Makerspace, closed-toed shoes must also be worn at all times 
* Open-toed shoes, such as sandals, flip-flops, slippers, or high-heels are not allowed
* Loose, baggy clothing, hooded sweatshirts, and other clothing with dangling strings are not permitted within ten feet of a machine or robot. However, this can be circumvented by making sure they are not dangling (Ex: tucking in the dangling strings of a hooded sweatshirt inside of the sweatshirt)
* When working or observing within ten feet of a machine, wearing jewelry is not recommended as they can be caught inside the machine, potentially harming the wearer and others around them

### Hearing Protection
When operating any loud equipment (CNC Machines, circular saw, etc.), earmuffs, earplugs, or other hearing protection are highly recommended

### Eye Protection
* Safety Glasses with proper side shields are required at all times when in the Construction departmentâ€™s workspace (behind the yellow and black tape) and in the pit at competitions
* Safety Glasses are also required within ten feet of any soldering, wire cutting, or work involving power and electricity (including any work on the robot)

### Hand Protection
* Plastic or rubber gloves are required when handling solvents, acids, or any other potentially dangerous chemicals
* Latex gloves (not plastic or rubber) are required when administering first aid to an injured person

### Hair Protection
* If you have hair that goes down to your shoulders or below, you should tie it back in order to avoid having it caught in equipment or getting in the way of your work

### Respiratory Protection
* When operating machines such as the band saw or belt sander, it is important to wear proper respiratory protection, as they produce small particles that can be inhaled
* It is especially important to remember to wear them when working on wood or plastic/acrylic; these materials produce the most dust and fumes
