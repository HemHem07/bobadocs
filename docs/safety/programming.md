### Programming Safety Rules
These rules encompass the hazards that occur in the programming department, such as running or testing the robots code. Rules are not limited to these, as different circumstances arise.

### General Safety
* Make sure people are aware that the robot is running before conducting tests in order to avoid accidents. For example, yell “ROBOT ON” when turning on the robot
* Do not run the robot at full speed on the ground
* Do not enable the robot while people’s hands are inside
* Make sure teammates are aware before actuating any mechanisms
* Use caution when handling fragile components to avoid anything breaking. (ie. the Jetson)
* Ground yourself when using components that are sensitive to static shock
* Stay aware of your surroundings and others around you when working
* When testing the robot’s autonomous code, always keep hand over the Emergency Stop to prevent injury in case the robot runs farther than expected

### Organization
* At the end of every meeting, shut down laptops and plug them in
* Keep wires and cables organized to eliminate any tripping hazards

### Sanitization
* Consuming food or drink near computers is prohibited. If needed, eat at the designated Food Table
