Each year, teams of students are challenged to raise funds, design a team brand, and engineer an industrial-sized robot to compete in a field game against other teams. Teams can also have mentors, who are professionals that volunteer and lend their expertise to guide the team. \u201cIt\u2019s as close to real-world engineering as a student can get.\u201d - FIRST Website What Is The First Robotics Competition? \u00b6 History \u00b6 The FIRST Robotics Competition was founded in 1989 by inventor and entrepreneur Dean Kamen and retired MIT professor Woodie Flowers. Dean Kamen was unhappy with the number of women and minorities who did not consider STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) careers. The first competition season was held in 1992. Woodie Flowers (left) and Dean Kamen (right). FRC Pathway \u00b6 The FIRST Organization also holds competitions for students of varying ages. These include the... FIRST Lego League Junior: grades K-4 FIRST Lego League (FLL): grades 4-8 FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC): grades 7-12 FIRST Robotics Challenge (FRC): grades 9-12 (that's us!) Events \u00b6 There are two competition models which a team can opt into: regional and district competitions. Regionals: Teams begin by signing up for and competing in one or more regional competitions. Any team can attend a regional, and it usually houses 40-70 teams. By winning regionals, each team in the winning alliance (group of three teams) receives a ticket to the championships. (We use the regional model.) District: Compared to regionals, district competitions are smaller in scale, and entry is limited by geographic location. Instead of the winners ascending to the championships, teams compete for points in district competitions. Those with the most points attend the district championship event, and teams with the most points receive tickets to the championships. District competitions are more abundant and are cheaper than regionals, and teams are able to attend more events and play more matches. Championships: Teams from all over the world meet at the championship event and compete. The winner is automatically given a ticket to the next year\u2019s championship. Past championships were held in cities such as Houston, Detroit, and St. Louis. Competition events will oftentimes include extra activities for members to participate in. These include workshops and panels , where students and mentors present and discuss FRC related topics. Competition is also expensive (transportation, food, housing, sign-up fees, etc.), so teams spend time fundraising throughout the year. Winners for both regional and championship competitions, as well as select awards are awarded with a blue banner. Other Events \u00b6 Community Events: Aside from regional and championship events, members in the community also hold their own competition events. Examples include... Chezy Champs, hosted by Team 254 (Bellarmine College Preparatory, San Jose) MadTown Throwdown, hosted by Team 1323 CalGames, hosted by the Western Regional Robotics Forum Fun Fact During the 2019 season, nearly 100,000 high school students on 3,940 FIRST Robotics Competition teams will compete in 100 District Events, 11 District Championships, and 62 Regional Events. FIRST Philosophies & Core Values \u00b6 FIRST has two main philosophies which it encourages its members to adopt not only during the time they spend in the program, but into their own lives. Gracious Professionalism (GP) \u00b6 Gracious Professionalism is a way of doing things that encourages high-quality work, emphasizes the value of others, and respects individuals and the community. People who practice Gracious Professionalism learn how to both compete fiercely, while also respecting and being kind to others. \u201cThey avoid treating anyone like losers. Knowledge, competition, and empathy are comfortably blended.\u201d - FIRST Website Woodie Flowers explains Gracious Professionalism Coopertition \u00b6 Coopertition is displaying unqualified kindness and respect in the face of fierce competition. The idea is founded on the philosophy that teams can and should help and cooperate with each other even as they compete. Coopertition involves both learning from and teaching teammates. It is learning from mentors, both managing and being managed.

CAD stands for Computer Aided Design, and there are a bunch of CAD softwares out there. Some of the more popular ones include Solidworks, Fusion 360, AutoCAD, and of course, Onshape. Each software has their own unique features and quirks, but they accomplish the same goal: they allow you to create detailed digital models so you can easily design, test, and iterate almost anything. So why use Onshape? First, Onshape can be used directly from your browser , so it's much more accessible than other CAD programs that require a dedicated installation. Second, Onshape is completely free ; other software is often very expensive. Third, Onshape allows you to share your projects, so that multiple people can work on the same project at once. Most other softwares don\u2019t have this feature. Ok with that out of the way, let's talk Onshape. What is it? How do I get started? Well, the link to the website is here . You\u2019ll need to create a free account first, and to do that you\u2019ll need to click on the \u201cget started\u201d button on the site. Then follow the prompts to create and activate your account. You may need to select the \u201cstudent\u201d option and fill in details about your school. Alternatively, you can also create an account through the sign inpage with the \u201csign up\u201d option. Important It's important to note that Onshape uses WebGL, so you\u2019ll need to check your computer's graphics requirements, and be using a browser that supports it.

Intro to Onshape"},{"location":"onshape/intro/#intro-to-onshape","text":"","title":"Intro to Onshape"},{"location":"onshape/intro/#introduction","text":"Before you get started with Onshape, it's useful to understand the whats and whys of CAD. CAD stands for Computer Aided Design, and there are a bunch of CAD softwares out there. Some of the more popular ones include Solidworks, Fusion 360, AutoCAD, and of course, Onshape. Each software has their own unique features and quirks, but they accomplish the same goal: they allow you to create detailed digital models so you can easily design, test, and iterate almost anything. So why use Onshape? First, Onshape can be used directly from your browser , so it's much more accessible than other CAD programs that require a dedicated installation. Second, Onshape is completely free ; other software is often very expensive. Third, Onshape allows you to share your projects, so that multiple people can work on the same project at once. Most other softwares don\u2019t have this feature. Ok with that out of the way, let's talk Onshape. What is it? How do I get started? Well, the link to the website is here . You\u2019ll need to create a free account first, and to do that you\u2019ll need to click on the \u201cget started\u201d button on the site. Then follow the prompts to create and activate your account. You may need to select the \u201cstudent\u201d option and fill in details about your school. Alternatively, you can also create an account through the sign inpage with the \u201csign up\u201d option. Important It's important to note that Onshape uses WebGL, so you\u2019ll need to check your computer's graphics requirements, and be using a browser that supports it.

Onshape provides users with a list of mates, along with mate connectors, which allow you to define custom mating points. View Document: Brief Overview Of Mating Mating is the connection of separate parts (part studios) together to form one cohesive piece or model of a product. Mating on Onshape must be done in the Assembly tab. Mating is done through the use of Mate Connectors. These are little circle icons that appear when you select a mate option in an assembly. Select two mate connectors while inside a mate menu and they will mate together. Onshape automatically selects common mating positions for objects and creates mate connectors on them for your convenience, but if you want to attach an object to a place where there is no predefined mate connector, you can select the mate connector option and create your own. Mates work by defining and restricting the degrees of freedom of an object. To find out specifics about each mate, access the document below. https://learn.onshape.com/learn/course/fundamentals-onshape-assemblies/mating-assembly-components/onshape-mate-types?page=3 You can also look at the icons in Onshape itself. They show you the degrees of motion that the mate allows. The fasten mate restricts all movement and so its icon has no arrows. The revolute mate allows rotational motion only. Its icon reflects this. Some mates will have limits, or degree values, which allow you to restrict its motion further. These are located in the menus of their respective mates. Others may allow you to change the axis of the mate and flip it around or offset its position. You can suppress mates just like you can hide sketches by right clicking on the mate in the left menu. These will cancel their function in the document until you unsuppress them. This is also where you can isolate them or make them transparent. Degrees of Freedom \u00b6 Mates control the degrees of freedom of your part. Every object has 6 degrees of freedom, rotational (around an axis) and translational (up, down, left, right) in each of the three planes (top, left/right, front). It\u2019s difficult to keep track of which degrees/what motion a mate limits, I\u2019d recommend just looking at the mate icons to discern which degrees/what motion a mate allows instead. View Video Lesson: (Mate Connectors, All Mates, Joint Limits) Tip When, working with many parts, it can sometimes be difficult to select a specific part you need.

Let\u2019s start working on creating sketches. View Video Lesson: Sketching and Constraining Basics Constraining Objects \u00b6 An important concept in any CAD software, not just Onshape, is constraining . Constraining is the process of limiting or restricting the entities in your sketch. To constrain a sketch follow the Size, Location, Orientation process . Any type of sketch will need to fulfill these three conditions to be defined. Size: This is a measurement of the entity itself. Location: This defines the entity\u2019s position in 3D space. Orientation: This is the \u201cdirection\u201d that an entity is in. Relations provide ways to quickly define a sketch entity\u2019s size, location, and orientation. Understanding them will help you create more detailed sketches and troubleshoot errors quickly. View Video Lesson: Relations Reading Sketches \u00b6 It\u2019s also important to be able to understand diagrams of 3D models. Interpreting sketches can vary depending on the type of sketch, but there are certain symbols you will tend to see across the majority of drawings. For the most part, all the information about a model can be found from its diagram, but sometimes dimensions/relations will need to be inferred. The resources below list some of the more common symbols found in diagrams. Now let's look at the relations we can infer from this diagram. Other Sketching Features and Troubleshooting \u00b6 There\u2019re a number of other sketch features in Onshape that allow you to simplify your work and decrease clutter in your sketches. View Video Lesson: Construction Lines, Patterning, Mirroring If at any point your sketch becomes too cluttered, you can always right click on sketches in your features tab (left side) and suppress it. This will make the entity invisible until you right click on the tab again and unsuppress it. Troubleshooting Sketches \u00b6 Two common issues encountered while sketching are red entities which occur when an entity is over defined... Overdefined Sketch This entity has conflicting constraints. It has been defined as having both a 2 and 4 inch radius. ...and blue entities, which occur when an entity is under defined. Underdefined Sketch This entity must be further constrained. It lacks both a side and bottom measurement. Here\u2019re some tips for troubleshooting: Examine the sketch and look for errors in constraining (dimensioning or relation) If the sketch\u2019s name in the sketch menu and features tab is red , hover over it and check the error message. If your entities are blue , pull on them and see which way they move. You may have broken an existing relation and may need to add new ones. Use the undo button or delete the entities and restart the portion of your sketch. Reload your webpage. Onshape can be buggy sometimes.

Our team uses Command Robot . You can find the templates here and examples here . Project Location : This determines the folder in which the robot project will be located. Create New Folder : If this is checked, a new folder will be created to hold the project within the previously-specified folder. If it is not checked, the project will be located directly in the previously-specified folder. An error will be thrown if the folder is not empty and this is not checked. You almost always want this to be checked. Project Name : The name of the robot project. This also specifies the name that the project folder will be given if the Create New Folder box is checked. Our code for each year is named with the format Code<year> ie: Code2020 . Team Number : The team number for the project, which will be used for package names within the project and to locate the robot when deploying code. Our team number is 253 . Once all the above have been configured, click \u201cGenerate Project\u201d and the robot project will be created. Opening The New Project \u00b6 After successfully creating your project, VS Code will give the option of opening the project as shown below. We can choose to do that now or later by typing Ctrl + K then Ctrl + O (or just Cmd + O on macOS) and select the folder where we saved our project. Once opened, we will see the project hierarchy on the left. Double-clicking on a file will open that file in the editor.

This is an intro to our robot structure, so we won't go into specifics on how to actually write the code until the next section. Gradle \u00b6 When creating a robot project, Gradle will automatically generate the files build.gradle , gradle/ , gradlew , gradlew.bat , settings.gradle . You shouldn't ever need to touch these. Your IDE may also generate the folders bin/ , build/ , .wpilib/ , .vscode/ , and .idea/ . It's safe to ignore these files as well. vendordeps \u00b6 The vendordeps/ folder in our robot code contains .json files that identify third party libraries we use. You can read more about it here . src \u00b6 Just like any other Java project, the src/ directory holds all of our actual code. src/main/java/frc/robot/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 Constants.java \u251c\u2500\u2500 Main.java \u251c\u2500\u2500 Robot.java \u251c\u2500\u2500 RobotContainer.java \u251c\u2500\u2500 commands/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 ConveyorQueue.java \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 Drive.java \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 Shoot.java \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 VisionTrack.java \u2514\u2500\u2500 subsystems/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 Arm.java \u251c\u2500\u2500 Climber.java \u251c\u2500\u2500 Conveyor.java \u251c\u2500\u2500 Drivetrain.java \u251c\u2500\u2500 Intake.java \u2514\u2500\u2500 Shooter.java Main.java \u00b6 This file is autogenerated, and there is rarely any reason to touch this file at all. It contains the classic main method, which is run at startup and starts up the rest of the robot code. Robot.java \u00b6 This file is the control center of the robot. It has the methods that are called to run the robot. Documentation on each of the methods within it can be found here . Constants.java \u00b6 This file contains all the numbers that don't change and are relevant to the whole robot. This includes all ports and joystick buttons, which correlate to motor controllers, solenoids, and commands in the code. RobotContainer.java \u00b6 This is where we create and store the objects for the subsystems, and set up all the controller and joystick commands that the driver uses to operate the robot. It does not extend from any superclasses, and is mainly used as a way to separate code from Robot.java commands/ \u00b6 Commands are what run the robot. For example, there may be a RunIntake command that runs two motors to turn the wheels that intake a game piece. subsystems/ \u00b6 Subsystems are another name for robot mechanisms, such as a drivetrain, a shooter, an intake, or a climber. The subsystem classes contain the Objects for the motor controllers and solenoids and have methods for controlling the subsystem, which are used by commands. Deploying code to the robot \u00b6 Note Deploying code to the RoboRIO only works on a Windows computer; however, you can still build your code to see if it compiles correctly. Now that you've created a robot project, you may want to deploy your code to the robot. In order to do this you'll need a few things: A Windows computer with the driver station software installed A RoboRIO connected to an electronics board (radio optional) and a battery If you do not have the radio, have a USB-B cable handy to connect your computer to the RIO With the radio: Disconnect from your wifi network and connect to the radio's wifi network. Without the radio: Plug the computer into the RoboRIO using a USB-B cable. Now that you're connected, it's time to actually deploy your code. Follow the WPILib instructions to deploy your code to the robot. Writing robot code \u00b6 Now you know how to deploy your code. Let's learn how to interact with physical components of the robot. Javadocs \u00b6 Java has a standard documentation format that is autogenerated from documentation comments in the code. We will be referencing them extensively to write our code. On top of a Javadoc contains a description of the class, its package, what it inherits, and more. Below that is a section containing the class' constructors, and the section below contains the methods you can call from that class. If you click on any of the constructors or methods, you get directed to a section with more details about what you clicked. Here's a Javadoc of a class you should be familiar with: ArrayList . WPILib \u00b6 WPILib is the name of the library FRC provides us to control the robot with. Its JavaDocs are located here (and you can also find a link to them in the Resources page of this site). We will be mostly using the library's edu.wpi.first.wpilibj package, and you can search for a class or method using the search bar located in the top right corner of the javadocs page. Practice \u00b6 First has a pretty good write-up on command-based programming , so we'll read that. Once you're done, we'll practice writing some basic commands. Before you start If you have access to a robot and would like to test your code, you will need the following items: items from the previous section an Xbox controller a Talon SRX a brushless motor Ask your teammates in the electronics department for help :) If you are new to git, read the intro to git section before proceeding. Clone the TrainingRobot project , and open it in VSCode. You can check if you have got the right project open by deploying the project to the robot and pressing the X button on the controller. If the motor spins, you've got the right code! Note VSCode may prompt you to \"import project to 2020\". Don't do this. Warning Please don't actually push any of your changes to the Github repository. Part 1: Basic IO \u00b6 Let's change the button to trigger the command continuously while it's held rather than when it's pressed. In the TrainingRobot project, find the RobotContainer.java file ( src/main/java/frc/robot/RobotContainer.java ). Currently, line 51 contains the method whenPressed() . Refer to the WPILib Javadocs to determine what you need to change whenPressed() to in order to run the command while the button is pressed. Hint controller_X is an instance of the JoystickButton class. In the same project, you'll find the RunMotor.java file in the commands/ directory. In the RunMotor class, the end() method is currently empty. Add code to it that stops the motors. Hint You might want to write something similar to what's in execute() . Once you think you figured it out, follow the above Deploying robot code section again to deploy, and see if your code worked! Solutions RobotContainer.java private void bindIO () { controller_X . whileHeld ( new RunMotor ( motors )); } commands/RunMotor.java @Override public void end ( boolean interrupted ) { motors . run ( 0 ); } Part 2: Default commands \u00b6 Right now, our motor only has two states: half power, or completely off. Let's make the motor's speed correspond to more granular controller input using a joystick. Again in the RobotContainer.java file, modify the bindIO() method to set the default command of the Motors subsystem to the RunMotors command. Hint Get the joystick's Y-value from the XboxController we already have defined. Hint Motors is an implementation of the Subsystem interface. Pass the Motors subsystem into the command and have it drive the motors to the Y-value of the joystick when executed. Use the prewritten code, the command-based programming tutorial , and the WPILib JavaDocs for help. Example Solution This is one way to implement this step. Yours may look a little different, but the same logic should appear here. Robotcontainer.java import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.GenericHID ; private void bindIO () { motors . setDefaultCommand ( new RunMotor ( motors )); } public static double getMotorSpeed () { // the vertical axis of the left joystick of the XboxController return controller . getY ( GenericHID . Hand . kLeft ); } commands/RunMotor.java import frc.robot.RobotContainer ; @Override public void execute () { motors . run ( RobotContainer . getMotorSpeed ()); } Again, deploy your code to the robot to see if it worked!

The Driver Station log file reports packet loss with orange bars with respect to time. Cause: Lost communication packets between your computer/FMS and your robot's radio and roboRIO. Additionally, your robot could have lost power for a brief period before reconnecting. Solution: During Competition Matches: Contact the field FTA/FTAA for assistance All other situations: Reduce surrounding wireless interference (hotspots/Wifi APs) Switch to a wired connection via USB or Ethernet Make sure the driver station laptop's battery mode is set to Performance and not Battery Saver Check power/data connections between radio and VRM, radio and roboRIO, battery to VRM, and battery to roboRIO Check that the ethernet port the router is connected to is not loose (consider hotgluing the connection for competition) Restart router/roboRIO Check for your code. Certain processes can lead to high packet loss.

Use a battery beak to check charge % (Full Charge is 130%) and battery resistance. Battery Tips Full Charge: 130% (Anything over 115% should be enough) Lower internal battery resistance is better (<0.025 ohm) Check the Driver Station Log File for diagnostic information for battery voltage and power delivery via the PDP Use separate batteries for competition and practice/testing Compressor \u00b6 Issue: Compressor refusing to run even after checking the wiring and pneumatic system. Solution: Make sure that the default compressor settings are not being overridden. Specifically, check that compressor.stop() is not present, as this will disable the automatic pressure control of the Pneumatics Control Module (PCM) Compressors do not need to be instantiated to function at a basic level.

Expected Capabilities \u00b6 Here are our expected capabilities for alliance robots during the playoffs. Our robot is designed around being a first pick. Ability Top 4 Alliance Captain First Pick Second Pick Climbing Climb power switch with leveling/even out capability/buddy climb Climb power switch and stay there Climb power switch and stay there Spin/Rotational Control Spin control panel with both positional and rotational control Spin control panel with rotational control Scoring Consistency Score high goal nearly every time Score high goal consistently Play defense or score on low goal Scoring Quantity Score three or more balls in high goal during autonomous period Score three balls in high goal during autonomous period Score on low goal during autonomous Number of Balls Stored Pick up and store five balls at a time Pick up and store five balls at a time Floor Intake Intake balls from the floor Intake balls from the floor Passable Through Trench Be able to go through the trench Preferably go through trench Tea3PO's Design \u00b6 Climbing Mechanism \u00b6 The climbing mechanism is a top priority for our robot. The endgame climb is the highest single-action scoring opportunity in a match. To get the endgame ranking point , each alliance needs a minimum of two robots hanging on the shield generator. No Control Panel Mechanism \u00b6 A spinner mechanism for the Control Panel was of low priority only beneficial for gaining RP, which isn\u2019t important in playoffs. focused more on designing the shooter High Goal Shooter \u00b6 We chose to design a shooter mechanism that could score high-goal as quickly as possible. Rule G11 in Section 7.2.3 of the 2020 game manual states that any robot within it\u2019s target scoring zone is protected from other robots . Because of this rule we decided to create a shooter optimized for shooting within the target zone . One of our prototype shooters Autonomous Shooting \u00b6 We decided that it was extremely valuable to take advantage of the autonomous double point scoring period . At the start of each match, each robot can hold up to three balls. Ground Intake \u00b6 Initially, we put a ground intake as a lower priority, but later in the season it was determined that a ground intake gave us significant strategic advantages. would allow us to intake balls anywhere on the field. Mechanisms of the Robot \u00b6 Drivetrain \u00b6 Chassis and Wheel \u00b6 The robot has a 31\" x 28\" West Coast drive base with six 6\" VEXpro traction wheels. 6\" wheels give us sufficient ground clearance over the 1\" metal tubes in the rendezvous point We added a 1/16\" center drop to decrease the skid in our front and back wheels to allow for smoother pivoting . To reduce the distance that the power cells have to travel while maintaining chassis stability, we cut a 7\" section on our front rail that allows for power cells to pass into the robot. The cut allows for power cells to be taken into the robot while still maintaining contact with either the ground intake and conveyor belt at all times without having an open chassis (shown below). Unlike closed chassis bots, open chassis bots do not require a ball to be raised above the front chassis frame . Drive Gearboxes \u00b6 Each side of the drivetrain is driven by a WCP SS gearbox with two falcon 550 motors geared at a 10.42-1 ratio . This helps achieve the robot\u2019s max speed of around 13 ft/s . Shooter \u00b6 Prototypes \u00b6 We had two main prototypes: a hooded shooter and a linear shooter . The linear shooter used two wheels on each side, and created relatively consistent and accurate shots. The hooded shooter also resulted in similar results. Both proved to have enough power to achieve the goals that we had set. We decided to go with the hooded shooter , as the hood increased the number of contact points between the mechanism and the power cell. We were concerned that any variation on the power cells, such as a tear or hole in the power cell, could drastically decrease the accuracy of our shots. Final Design \u00b6 The final shooter design consists of... two \u00bc\" thick polycarbonate rails with arcs 3D printed hood attaches to the rails to control the release angle and follow the contour of the shooter wheel a 3lb Neoprene drive roller (shooter wheel) driven by 2 NEO motors at a 1:1 ratio Shooting Demonstration Accumulator \u00b6 Prototypes \u00b6 Hopper vs Conveyor vs Ramp The Ramp \u00b6 We tested a shallow, gravity driven ramp , but decided that the speed at which the power cells feed into the shooter would be slower than we wanted . The Hopper \u00b6 Concerns about the hopper\u2019s potential to jam balls led to the conveyor being chosen over it. The Conveyor (Chosen!) \u00b6 We built a wooden prototype of the conveyor, but found that the single NEO brushless motor wasn\u2019t powerful enough to move the power cells through the system, so we settled for a two motor system. Final Design: Conveyor \u00b6 The final design is a conveyor that files power cells one by one. The conveyor is broken into two separate sections and has an \"L\" shape . Each section has a single NEO motor geared similarly to the shooter to minimize energy transfer between the shooter and the balls. For the horizontal section, brushes are placed inside the conveyor. The conveyor is capable of holding five power cells and accelerating to full speed, allowing all five power cells to exit the conveyor quickly. These push balls towards the rear and prevent jamming . The vertical section consists of a single conveyor with 0.5in compression to move the balls upward into the shooter wheel. This section automatically stores two balls vertically. Two photoelectric sensors are located at the top and bottom The bottom sensor detects balls and tells the conveyor to run and push balls up one at a time. The top sensor is used to keep space between stored balls and shooter wheel Ground Intake \u00b6 Prototypes \u00b6 To find the types of the wheels, height of the intake , and distance of the intake from the bumpers , we drove a hex shaft with a drill , varying the wheels and relative distances until we found the combination that would allow the power cells to be rolled up into the chassis. We realized that because the intake is only actuated by a motor on one side , the other side would not follow and retract into the robot, resulting in one side sinking down, or an asymmetrical intake . We solved this issue with a set of inner intake arms , connected by a churro shaft. We also found that the power cells were jamming between the intake and the conveyor . We added driven brushes to the churro support of our intake to help guide the power cells smoothly into the conveyor. Intake Demonstration Final Design \u00b6 The final ground intake has\u2026 Ten 3\" mecanum wheels on the intake and one center omni wheel , which center the power cells when they contact the intake. One pair of inner and one pair of outer polycarbonate arms , which support the hex shaft running across the front of the robot. The retraction is driven by a BAG motor and the spinning of the intake wheels is powered by a 775pro . Poly Cord belts run from the driven thunderhex shaft to the churro support, driving pulleys that spin the intake brushes. Climber \u00b6 Prototypes \u00b6 Telescoping Cascade vs 4-Bar Arm vs One Point Pivot The Telescoping Cascade The telescoping cascade was prototyped out of PVC and thin cable. It worked well, but would require us to either sacrifice not being able to fit under the trench , or build at least four stages to reach our target height. The 4-Bar Arm The 4-Bar Arm also worked effectively, but was eliminated for its complexity. The One Point Pivot (Chosen!) The team settled on the one point pivot arm because it was simple allowed us to reach our desired height achievable by our team Final Design \u00b6 Our final design is a one point pivoting climb with\u2026 Two vertical support bars , which are mounted at the front of the robot, with two aluminum 1x1 tubes on each side to act as arms. The arms are controlled by two 775pro motors , one for each arm. Two polycarbonate hooks for extra reach and to attach to the climbing bar. The hooks are 22\" long, and made of \u00bc\" thick polycarbonate. 3D printed bearing carriages allow the hooks to slide up and down the climber arms To Extend the Arm Gas shocks extend the climber arm upwards, and a constant force spring pulls the hooks up. A winch rope (paracord) holds the arms down, and when the motors actuate, allowing the winch rope to release, both the climber hooks and the arms are raised and the rope is unwound. If needed, bearing carriages will slide the hooks up and down the climber arms. To Retract the Arm At the start of the round, rope connecting the hooks and the motor is wound up in one direction. When we want to retract the arm, the motor continues to drive in the same direction, and the winch rope continues turning (in the same direction) and winds itself up again , allowing the arms to both extend out and retract back.
