The purpose of this section is for the reader to understand safe steps on how to use these tools efficiently for robotics work. It is important to read carefully about the tips and tricks for these tools in order to minimize the chance of injury when working on the robot! Must-Read for All Tools \u00b6 It is important that you don't use a tool to do tasks that it's not meant to be used for. For example, using a screwdriver as a mallet. Also, it's important to always remember to return tools back to the desinated areas after use before leaving the Maker Space. Screwdrivers \u00b6 There are two types of screwdrivers: phillips head and flathead. Always make sure to use the proper screwdriver on a screw. Use the screwdriver to take out and put in screws on a mechanism. An example is taking off bumper screws on a robot. Allen Key \u00b6 An allen key is used to drive bolts and screws with hexagonal sockets in their heads. Center Punch \u00b6 Center punches come in different sizes. They are used to mark the initial dent/hole before drilling it. After defining the horizontal and vertical, hold the pointed end of a center punch on the cross-section and hit the flat end with a mallet. This will create a mark, which you will drill out and/or drive a fastener into. Scribe \u00b6 DO NOT use the scribe as a center punch. Scribes are much longer and have sharper points, which are used to mark lines/outlines of a metal piece that are going to be cut. A sharpie works as well, but a scribe is better. Must-Read for Saws \u00b6 For both saws, make sure to use the entire blade to cut and don\u2019t saw in only one place because this would cause inconsistencies on the blade for the teeth would wear down faster than the other areas. Hand Saw \u00b6 The wood hand saw is used to cut wood, plywood, 2x4, and etc. Hacksaw \u00b6 The metal hand saw is used to cut small metal pieces, aluminum churros, ThunderHex, and etc. Pliers \u00b6 Pliers are used to hold small objects. It\u2019s function might vary depending on the type of plier. An example is removing hot bits. A type of plier is the gearbox snap ring. Wrench \u00b6 The wrench is use to grip, fasten, turn, tighten, and loosen things like locknuts, nuts, and bolts. It comes in different sizes. Mallets \u00b6 Mallets are mainly used to hit the center punch. Mallets are also used to apply force to parts to shape or move them with less risk of damaging parts. For example, applying force with the mallet to a bearing to get it into it\u2019s frame, then using the mallet to insert a hexshaft through the bearing(s). Rivets Guns \u00b6 Rivet guns are used to drive rivets in to fasten sheet metal or heavy fabric. The thicker side of the rivet goes into the hole, and the slimmer side goes into the rivet gun. When using the rivet gun, keep the rivet and rivet gun straight against the surface. To remove a rivet, drill it out.","title":"Hand Tools"},{"location":"construction/tools/handtools/#intro-to-hand-tools","text":"In the next section of the Tools documentation for construction, we will be examining various hand tools.

Power tools are a very important part of robotics, but they are also very dangerous. Make sure to read through this section thoroughly and don't be afraid to ask for help if you don't understand or are unsure of anything. Safety is our number one concern! Must-Read for ALL Power Tools: Always unplug after use, and only plug it in once you're ready to use Drivers and Drills \u00b6 Drivers are great for quickly and conveniently securing fasteners such as screws while drills are used for making holes. When putting on the bits on the driver/drill, remember the phrase \"righty-tighty, lefty, loosey\". It's important that you take the proper bit for the job as well (if it\u2019s a driver, match it up to the fastener head, if its a drill choose the right bit for the hole). For some, turn the chuck towards the left, so it\u2019s loose enough to fit the bit in. Once it\u2019s in place, secure the bit by tightening the chuck, usually twisting it right. Some drivers and drills allow you to push the chuck up, slide the bit in/out, and release, to secure it on. When finished using drills/drivers, always put the bits back before leaving the Maker Space. Return the bits to the box in their respective sections. The bit boxes stay near the drivers and drills storage area. Don't forget to return the drivers and drills back to the shelf as well. They should be connected to a battery, so that they can charge. Usually, you slide the battery on/off the drivers and drills. Drivers and drills are stored near the second door to the Maker Space on the shelves. Jigsaws \u00b6 Jigsaws are hand held power tools, so they're good for cutting irregular curves on big sheets/pieces that are hard to move. When switching out blades, choose which type of blade you need for the job before plugging the tool in. Blue blades are used for cutting metal while red/black blades are used for cutting wood. Another way to distinguish blades is to look at the teeth: smaller teeth (more TPI, or teeth per inch) is used for cutting metal while bigger teeth (less TPI) is used for cutting wood. Also note that the blade must be facing outwards when you are securing it in. Here are some tips for using jigsaws: Clamp down the piece being cut Start the blade before making contact with the part being cut Keep two hands on the jigsaw, one pressing the trigger and the other on the front of the saw (for stability) Stop cutting every once in a while to prevent the blade from heating up too much When done cutting, let the saw slow to a stop before removing it from the cut piece Circular Saws \u00b6 Circular saws are handheld tools used for cutting metal or wood stock precisely and/or in straight lines (ex. Dowel rods, 2x2's, 2x4's, etc.), or cutting into a part at an angle (used when constructing field elements). Here are some tips for using circular saws: Securely clamp down the part being cut Start the blade before making contact with the part being cut Firmly move the saw through the piece, making sure that the blade is lined up with the cut line Miter Saws \u00b6 Miter saws have a blade mounted on a swing arm that pivots left or right to produce angled cuts. In other words, they're not restircted by angles! They are used when cutting wood and plastic, and can achieve quick and straight or angular cuts. Here are some tips as well as a link on how to use miter saws: How to Use a Miter Saw Secure it to table Unplug from power saw, and install appropriate blade for what you\u2019re cutting Always use sharp blades to avoid kickback Tighten the blade securely into place Lower and secure the bladeguard after securing blade, with screwdriver Raise saw over piece and allow it to reach full speed To make a miter cut: pivot the blade and secure it down again Bandsaws \u00b6 Bandsaws are used for cutting smaller pieces that can fit on the stand or for cutting out smaller measurements. When using a bandsaw, make sure there is a blade in piece and that it's secured. Also make sure that the bandsaw cover is closed and secured. A key is needed to use the bandsaw, so DON'T LOSE IT! When using the bandsaw, whichever direction the blade is circling towards is the side you\u2019ll push the small wood or metal piece in slowly. Too fast, and the blade will get stuck in the wood piece/melt the metal piece. Too slow, and the blade could burn the piece (especially if it's wood). While using the bandsaw, wear gloves because the piece can get hot. Also use the excess pieces to push the piece you\u2019re cutting through the saw (so your fingers aren\u2019t close to the blade). If it gets stcuk on the piece, push it back a little (towards you) and then keep going (if this happens, it usually means you were going too fast). After you're done, always unplug the bandsaw. Here are some tips for switching out the blades (do this if you want to switch from metal to wood blades or vice versa) Make sure the bandsaw is unplugged Open the bandsaw cover by loosening the knob on the side To loosen the blades, turn the knob at the top. Wear fabric gloves to carefully hold the blade when removing it (there should be one, stretched across two wheels) Making sure they\u2019re in the right direction (the blades turn clockwise) when you \u2018stretch\u2019 the new blade across the two wheels It has to be centered on the wheel and a tight fit, so you must be precise and careful Return the removed blades to the bandsaw blade storage area Make sure to close the cover and re-tighten the knobs on the cover Portable Bandsaw \u00b6 Portable bandsaws are used for cutting stock, similar to a bandsaw, but when you don't have a regular bandsaw available. While using, keep one hand on the handle and the other hand on the switch. Hold the bandsaw firmly when cutting since the blade can catch the piece being cut. Don't cut \"flexible\" parts like sheet, aluminium, and L-brackets. Only cut \"rigid\" parts such as sheet steel, aluminum 2x4's, 2x2's, shafts, etc.) Drill Press \u00b6 Drill presses are used for precisely drilling holes into wood or metal. We often use them for drilling bearing holes into parts for the robot. Here are some tips on how to use drill presses: Do NOT wear gloves when using the drill press (gloves can get caught in the bit and pull hand in) Clamp everything securely to the stand Lift up from piece you\u2019re drilling every so often, and drill slowly Have a supervisor for beginners: especially for long pieces, so they can hold the other end; or when there is a shortage on clamps (they can help hold it in place) Always have one hand on the switch, one on the handle This means that your alignment has to be precise, so accurately mark it beforehand You can turn the handle to bring the drill down onto the piece (without turning the drill press on), to get a precise alignment for the hole you want to drill out To remove the bit, use the key to loosen the chunk, allowing for removal of the drill bit. Combination Square \u00b6 Combination squares are used for drawing accurate 90 or 45-degree angles for cutting. To use a combination square, line it up on the edge of the square, one for 90 degrees, one for 45 degrees. You can adjust the ruler by loosening the screw that connects it. Always keep the metal ruler with the combination square. Dremel \u00b6 Dremels are used for removing edges from metal pieces. While using the dremel, make sure not to touch the bit while it's moving. Remove a little bit of material at a time, lifting the bit away from the piece from time to time. Belt Sander \u00b6 Belt sanders are used for sanding down, cutting, or measurement errors on WOOD pieces to make them smoother or fit better on the robot. While using a belt sander, hold it with two hands: one on the handle and the other on the switch. Turn on the sander before making contact with the piece you are sanding. Always clamp down on the object you are sanding. Arbor Press \u00b6 Arbor presses are used for pressing or removing a bearing from a bearing hole. When using an arbor press, have one hand on the part you are pressing and the other hand on the lever. Never place your hand underneath the press head.","title":"Power Tools"},{"location":"construction/tools/powertools/#intro-to-power-tools","text":"In the next section of the Tools document, we will be covering the different types of power tools we use as well as how to handle them safely.

Very nice. Now you can look at one of the most important aspects of Electronics: dealing with sensors. There are a myraid of things you can do with sensors and there are many different types of sensors. There are a lot of sensors and we will never use all of them at one time when making a robot, let alone do everything we possibly can with them at one time. However, there are some sensors you should know about and other pieces of info that you should know when dealing with sensors in electronics. Lets take a look. LiDAR \u00b6 A LiDAR(Light Detection And Ranging) sensor emits pulsed light waves into the surrounding environment. The pulses bounce off the objects and return to the sensor. Then, the sensor calculates the time it took to create an estimate of what objects look like and where they are (think echolocation but with lasers light pulses). These are useful for measuring the distances between the sensor and the object. For example, it can be equipped on drones to survey the terrain and create a 3d model. Example of LiDAR Model Using LiDAR can get you precise data quickly (It repeats millions of processes at once to create an accurate 3D map on a computer). Not only that, but the lasers are eye-safe so no one's getting hurt looking at a sensor. Look into LiDAR more with the following links: \"What is LiDAR\" Article More about LiDAR Basics of LiDAR Optical Encoders \u00b6 Optical Encoders are made up of four components: a light source, a sensor, a movable disk, and a fixed mask. Rotary encoders use a sensor to identify position change as light passes through a patterned encoder wheel or disk. It detects when light has passed through or not, with the rate of light passing through and being blocked being measured. Forces such as velocity, rotation, and position can be measured using an optical encoder. Example of an Optical Encoder Can measure multiple types of motion. For example, the speed of a wheel on a car or robot can be measured. The rate at which the light is allowed through and is blocked is measured, providing for the speed of the wheel. Though this can account for precise motion measurement, it has problems with debris and environments (light, smoke). This is because it can make it harder for light to be detected from the sensor. Magnetic Encoders \u00b6 A magnetic encoder is made up of three major components: a sensing circuit, a rotating wheel, and magnetic poles (north+south) spaced evenly around the wheel. Parts for Magnetic Encoders The encoder works by placing tiny north and south poles evenly around a rotating wheel. A sensor is then used to detect the tiny changes in magnetic direction, giving feedback on rotary information. Uses either hall effect or magneto resistive detection. Example of Magnetic Encoder The spinning wheels cause a response in the sensor based on the changes in magnetic direction. The response goes through a circuit and is displayed as a digital signal on a device. Can be used for measuring rotational motion on items such as wheels. These encoders are very accurate and reliable and produce high resolution, low cost feedback. It also cannot be contaminated by dirt and moisture unlike optical encoders. However, it is susceptable to interference with other magnets. Look into optical and magnetic encoders more with the following links: Encoders Info Magnetic VS Optical Encoders Hall Effect Sensors \u00b6 A hall effect sensor is a type of sensor that measures magnetism. Electricity is moved through a semi-conductive material, such as silicon, in a straight line. When a magnetic field is introduced, the electrons moving through the material deviate from their straight line and move to a positive or negative pole (beling attracted or repelled) on the material. The changes in voltage that come from the new curved electricity path is then measured. Example of Hall Effect Sensor Hall effect sensors are used to detect the motion of an object. For example, the position of a motor can be sensed by measuring the slight change in the magnetic field as the motor rotates. Hall effect sensors are also used in some magnetic encoders, as a sensor is required to detect the changes in magnetic fields on the disk. Look into hall effect sensors more with the following links: Basics of the Hall Effect What is a Hall Effect Sensor? Hall Effect Sensor Applications Ultrasonic Sensors \u00b6 Ultrasonic sensors measure distance by using ultrasonic waves. The sensor head emits an ultrasonic wave and receives the wave that is reflected back. They measure distance by calculating time between emission and the reception, very similar to echolocation. Example of Ultrasonic Senor in Action Ultrasonic sensors are used to measure the distance between the sensor and an object. We used it in an arduino lesson, where we took the output from this sensor and displayed the measured distance to the console. Check this lesson out. Example of Ultrasonic Sensor Be sure to research more about Ultrasonic sensors here: What is an Ultrasonic Sensor Comparison between Ultrasonic Sensors and Optical Sensors What is an Ultrasonic sensor? Potentiometers \u00b6 Potentiometers are adjustable rotary analog devices that can also act as variable resistors, which can change resistance with a dial. Potentiometers measure current, which is proportional to the distance. It uses a wiper to adjust the resistance (between 2 out of the three pins) of the potentiometer. The outside pings are the voltage and ground pins, while the inside (middle) pin is the resistive measurement. Example of potentiometer These are usually used to control speed, voltage, or frequency using a dial that you can rotate. This makes it easy to adjust anything using power whether it be the brightness of a light or the speed at which the intake runs. Example of adjusting dial Potentiometers have reliable output and are also very effiecent at measuring large displacements. It also has the unique ability to vary it's resistance, meaning that it is an analog sensor (wide range of inputs). To learn more about potentiometers, check out the links here: Potentiometers What is a Potentiometer Photoelectric Sensors \u00b6 The photoelectric sensor is a light based sensor. There is an emitter emitting light to a receiver. If the receiver does not see the light beam emitted from the emitter (the light beam is blocked), it detects an object. The light beam is typically infrared light. A specific sensor of this type would be a beam break sensor. Example of photoelectric sensor Photoelectric sensors can detect the presence or absence of an object in the light beam\u2019s pathway, the location of nearby and faraway objects, and changes in lighting. They can also detect any item regardless of material, including glass. To learn more about photoelectric sensors, check out the links here: Photoelectric Sensors Overview Applications of Photoelectric Sensors Limit Switches \u00b6 A limit switch is a mechanical device operated by a physical force applied by an object that detects the presence or absence of an object. It consists of an actuator which transfers external force to the built in switch. When pressed, the electrical circuit is either closed/opened. Example of a limit switch Limit switches can be used as a simple control or lock system. Items that also require a stop button due to a limited range of movement can also use a limit switch. For example, on 3D printers the x and y carriages have limit switches on them to prevent them from moving too far and breaking the machine. Limit switches are liked due to their small and simple design, inexpensiveness, and and sturdiness (can last for many clicks). Example of the design of a limit switch To learn more about limit switches, check out the links here: Limit Switches Limit Switches Explained Technical Explanation for Limit Switches Magnetometers \u00b6 This sensor measures the strength and sometimes the direction of the magnetic fields. It also can be used to calibrate magnets to determine magnetization of materials. There are two types of magnetometers (classified by their calibration methods): - Scalar magnetometers - Quality of attractive fields - Vector magnetometers - Direction of heading Example of a magnetometer Magnetometers are used to measure values such as the earth\u2019s magnetic field. They can detect other magnets in the vicinity and give feedback on them. If an FRC game piece has a magnet in them, you can detect it! To learn more about magnetometers, check out the links here: Magnetometers what is a Magnetometer Accelerometers \u00b6 Any motion, even the force of gravity, can be detected by accelerometers. A small bit of silicon detects vibration/force applied to it. Example of an accelerometer Accelerometers are used to detect linear motion (acceleration of an object, hence the name, accelerometer). Such motions include an increase/decrease in speed, sharp turns, strong impacts, bumps and vibrations. They can also find out the angle the device is tilted at with respect to the earth by measuring the amount of static acceleration due to gravity. By combining multiple accelerometers, you can get more axes of information (not just linear motion, but for pitch or yaw).

Very nice. Now you can look at one of the most important aspects of Electronics: dealing with sensors. There are a myraid of things you can do with sensors and there are many different types of sensors. There are a lot of sensors and we will never use all of them at one time when making a robot, let alone do everything we possibly can with them at one time. However, there are some sensors you should know about and other pieces of info that you should know when dealing with sensors in electronics. Lets take a look.","title":"Intro to Sensors"},{"location":"electronics/sensors/#lidar","text":"A LiDAR(Light Detection And Ranging) sensor emits pulsed light waves into the surrounding environment. The pulses bounce off the objects and return to the sensor. Then, the sensor calculates the time it took to create an estimate of what objects look like and where they are (think echolocation but with lasers light pulses). These are useful for measuring the distances between the sensor and the object. For example, it can be equipped on drones to survey the terrain and create a 3d model. Example of LiDAR Model Using LiDAR can get you precise data quickly (It repeats millions of processes at once to create an accurate 3D map on a computer). Not only that, but the lasers are eye-safe so no one's getting hurt looking at a sensor.

Rotary encoders use a sensor to identify position change as light passes through a patterned encoder wheel or disk. It detects when light has passed through or not, with the rate of light passing through and being blocked being measured. Forces such as velocity, rotation, and position can be measured using an optical encoder. Example of an Optical Encoder Can measure multiple types of motion. For example, the speed of a wheel on a car or robot can be measured. The rate at which the light is allowed through and is blocked is measured, providing for the speed of the wheel. Though this can account for precise motion measurement, it has problems with debris and environments (light, smoke). This is because it can make it harder for light to be detected from the sensor.","title":"Optical Encoders"},{"location":"electronics/sensors/#magnetic-encoders","text":"A magnetic encoder is made up of three major components: a sensing circuit, a rotating wheel, and magnetic poles (north+south) spaced evenly around the wheel. Parts for Magnetic Encoders The encoder works by placing tiny north and south poles evenly around a rotating wheel. A sensor is then used to detect the tiny changes in magnetic direction, giving feedback on rotary information. Uses either hall effect or magneto resistive detection. Example of Magnetic Encoder The spinning wheels cause a response in the sensor based on the changes in magnetic direction. The response goes through a circuit and is displayed as a digital signal on a device. Can be used for measuring rotational motion on items such as wheels. These encoders are very accurate and reliable and produce high resolution, low cost feedback. It also cannot be contaminated by dirt and moisture unlike optical encoders.

When a magnetic field is introduced, the electrons moving through the material deviate from their straight line and move to a positive or negative pole (beling attracted or repelled) on the material. The changes in voltage that come from the new curved electricity path is then measured. Example of Hall Effect Sensor Hall effect sensors are used to detect the motion of an object. For example, the position of a motor can be sensed by measuring the slight change in the magnetic field as the motor rotates. Hall effect sensors are also used in some magnetic encoders, as a sensor is required to detect the changes in magnetic fields on the disk.

Example of potentiometer These are usually used to control speed, voltage, or frequency using a dial that you can rotate. This makes it easy to adjust anything using power whether it be the brightness of a light or the speed at which the intake runs. Example of adjusting dial Potentiometers have reliable output and are also very effiecent at measuring large displacements.

In the Pits \u00b6 The pit is an area where teams station, repair, and conduct maintenance on their robot between matches. Typically only a few members (dubbed the pit crew and typically from technical departments) are allowed in the pit at a time to prevent overcrowding. Oftentimes members balance other activities like scouting or being on the drive team with their pit work. Team 253\u2019s pit crew during the 2016 San Francisco Regionals. Drive Team \u00b6 The drive team is a subgroup of the team that is focused on managing the robot on the field. The traditional drive team consists of a driver, operator, technician, drive coach , and human player , but the member roles can vary depending on the game. Each member is assigned a specific task. During build season, drive trials are held to determine drive team members. Driver and Operator: The driver controls the robot during matches and the operator works with the driver to score game pieces. Only the driver and operator are allowed to touch the driver station (robot controls) during matches. Drive Coach: The drive coach manages the drive team. Some of their responsibilities include developing match strategies with alliance partners and passing on the information to the rest of the drive team. During matches, the drive coach can guide the driver and operator. Technician: The technician is the drive team\u2019s resource for the troubleshooting and maintenance of the robot on the field. To help them troubleshoot, technicians should have an understanding of the systems that connect the robot to the driver station. This includes the operator console as well as the robot\u2019s electronics, like the radio, roboRIO, and battery. Human Player: The human player directly interacts with game pieces during matches, with their task varying between games. There can be multiple human players who can be cycled through, but only 1 is allowed per match. Scouting \u00b6 An important part of any team\u2019s success at competition is scouting, where groups of students from one team collect information on other team\u2019s robots. Pit Scouting: Team scouting usually involves approaching the pit crew of another team and asking a set of questions about their robot. The information gleaned from scouting helps teams with forming pick lists and guides their match strategies. Match Scouting: Teams will also send scouters to record information about another team\u2019s performance during matches. This is helpful for determining a team\u2019s recent performance, which can change over the course of a competition (for example if a robot suffered a mechanism failure or if the driver was inconsistent). Department Scouting: The process of department scouting is the same as with team scouting, but the purpose differs in that it is done specifically to help departments learn about new techniques and mechanisms that other teams are using. Department scouts use different scouting forms than team scouts. Game Strategy \u00b6 Before a match, the drive teams of an alliance often come together and discuss strategy. This will usually involve assessing what each team should be doing at each stage of the match (auto, teleop, endgame), planning out routes on the field to avoid congestion, and predicting and countering the opposing alliance\u2019s strategy.

Alliance Selection \u00b6 After an initial set of qualification matches, teams participate in alliance selections, in which the top 8 ranked teams formally invite other teams to form a playoff alliance. Playoff alliances do not change and will persist for the duration of the playoffs, until the alliance is eliminated or wins the finals match. Teams can form pick lists to help them determine what teams they will extend an invitation to OR what teams they would accept offers from during alliance selections. Competition Awards & Judges \u00b6 Teams are eligible to receive a number of awards at a competition event. These include technical awards like the... Autonomous Award Creativity Award Excellence in Engineering Award Industrial Design Award and team attribute awards like the...

Due to this teams are encouraged to keep a knowledgeable member in the pit at all times, though any pit crew member should be prepared to answer questions. At the end of each competition, a closing ceremony is held where the award winners are announced. Offseason Competitions \u00b6 There are a variety of offseason competitions that teams can participate in. These events are often hosted by other teams in the community; examples include Team 254\u2019s Chezy Champs event, Team 2073\u2019s Capital City Classic event, and the Western Region Robotics Forum\u2019s (WRRF) Calgames.

Teams can also have mentors, who are professionals that volunteer and lend their expertise to guide the team. \u201cIt\u2019s as close to real-world engineering as a student can get.\u201d - FIRST Website What Is The First Robotics Competition? \u00b6 History \u00b6 The FIRST Robotics Competition was founded in 1989 by inventor and entrepreneur Dean Kamen and retired MIT professor Woodie Flowers. Dean Kamen was unhappy with the number of women and minorities who did not consider STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) careers. The first competition season was held in 1992. Woodie Flowers (left) and Dean Kamen (right). FRC Pathway \u00b6 The FIRST Organization also holds competitions for students of varying ages. These include the... FIRST Lego League Junior: grades K-4 FIRST Lego League (FLL): grades 4-8 FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC): grades 7-12 FIRST Robotics Challenge (FRC): grades 9-12 (that's us!) Events \u00b6 There are two competition models which a team can opt into: regional and district competitions. Regionals: Teams begin by signing up for and competing in one or more regional competitions. Any team can attend a regional, and it usually houses 40-70 teams. By winning regionals, each team in the winning alliance (group of three teams) receives a ticket to the championships. (We use the regional model.) District: Compared to regionals, district competitions are smaller in scale, and entry is limited by geographic location. Instead of the winners ascending to the championships, teams compete for points in district competitions. Those with the most points attend the district championship event, and teams with the most points receive tickets to the championships. District competitions are more abundant and are cheaper than regionals, and teams are able to attend more events and play more matches. Championships: Teams from all over the world meet at the championship event and compete. The winner is automatically given a ticket to the next year\u2019s championship. Past championships were held in cities such as Houston, Detroit, and St. Louis. Competition events will oftentimes include extra activities for members to participate in. These include workshops and panels , where students and mentors present and discuss FRC related topics. Competition is also expensive (transportation, food, housing, sign-up fees, etc.), so teams spend time fundraising throughout the year. Winners for both regional and championship competitions, as well as select awards are awarded with a blue banner. Other Events \u00b6 Community Events: Aside from regional and championship events, members in the community also hold their own competition events. Examples include... Chezy Champs, hosted by Team 254 (Bellarmine College Preparatory, San Jose) MadTown Throwdown, hosted by Team 1323 CalGames, hosted by the Western Regional Robotics Forum Fun Fact During the 2019 season, nearly 100,000 high school students on 3,940 FIRST Robotics Competition teams will compete in 100 District Events, 11 District Championships, and 62 Regional Events. FIRST Philosophies & Core Values \u00b6 FIRST has two main philosophies which it encourages its members to adopt not only during the time they spend in the program, but into their own lives. Gracious Professionalism (GP) \u00b6 Gracious Professionalism is a way of doing things that encourages high-quality work, emphasizes the value of others, and respects individuals and the community. People who practice Gracious Professionalism learn how to both compete fiercely, while also respecting and being kind to others. \u201cThey avoid treating anyone like losers. Knowledge, competition, and empathy are comfortably blended.\u201d - FIRST Website Woodie Flowers explains Gracious Professionalism Coopertition \u00b6 Coopertition is displaying unqualified kindness and respect in the face of fierce competition. The idea is founded on the philosophy that teams can and should help and cooperate with each other even as they compete. Coopertition involves both learning from and teaching teammates. It is learning from mentors, both managing and being managed.

Here we will go over the key aspects of competition as well as competition vocabulary so you can be prepared for first competition Kickoff \u00b6 Onseason (build-season) begins with a broadcasted kickoff event, where details on the year\u2019s game are revealed. A video animation of the game is typically shown and a code to unlock the game manual, a document specifying the rules and other details of the game. After kickoff, teams will begin the planning, brainstorming, and building process. Game Vocabulary \u00b6 Before we look at competition, lets look at some key terminology we use at competition. Alliance: A group of three teams that work together in a game. In qualification matches this is random, but during playoffs, alliances are chosen. (All matches are in a 3v3 format.) Match Points: Points earned throughout a match by scoring or completing activities in the game. The alliance with the most points wins the match. Ranking Points: Points earned through select activities in the game and winning matches. Ranking points go towards a team\u2019s rank. Qualification Matches: Matches where random alliances compete against each other to score match and ranking points. Playoff Matches: Matches where the top 4 alliances compete against each other to score match points only. 2 losses for any team results in an elimination. Matches are played until one winning alliance remains. Penalties: Certain actions, such as intentionally damaging other robots and throwing game pieces outside of boundaries are prohibited during matches, and will result in punishments ranging from point deduction to disqualification. Autonomous Period: The period in the beginning of matches where robots are pre-loaded with game pieces and are allowed to attempt to score points while driven entirely by code. Teleop Period: This phase occurs for the rest of the match time. Teams have manual control over their robot and work together in alliances to score points. Defense: Some alliances will dedicate a bot to protect their alliance\u2019s robots from incoming attackers or prevent enemy bots from scoring. Endgame: The period towards the end of the match where teams have the chance to gain extra points by completing a special action.

Then, the model is given a rough 3D shape through the extrusion process, which involves extruding, revolving, sweeping, lofting, etc. Finally, the model\u2019s details are added through the features like the fillet, chamfer, shell, hole, etc. This is important because features like the chamfer and fillet will consume or change the dimensions of the edges it has been placed on, so if you want to reference a certain face after a feature has been applied on it , it will have changed.

The last environment we\u2019ll cover is the assembly environment! The assembly environment is used for modeling interactions between different parts, and it allows users to build more complex objects (called assemblies) from existing parts. View Video Lesson: Navigating the Assembly Environment (Grouping, Fixing, Inserting, Subassemblies) Mating \u00b6 Mating is key to shaping the way your part studios interact with each other. Onshape provides users with a list of mates, along with mate connectors, which allow you to define custom mating points. View Document: Brief Overview Of Mating Mating is the connection of separate parts (part studios) together to form one cohesive piece or model of a product. Mating on Onshape must be done in the Assembly tab. Mating is done through the use of Mate Connectors. These are little circle icons that appear when you select a mate option in an assembly. Select two mate connectors while inside a mate menu and they will mate together. Onshape automatically selects common mating positions for objects and creates mate connectors on them for your convenience, but if you want to attach an object to a place where there is no predefined mate connector, you can select the mate connector option and create your own. Mates work by defining and restricting the degrees of freedom of an object. To find out specifics about each mate, access the document below. https://learn.onshape.com/learn/course/fundamentals-onshape-assemblies/mating-assembly-components/onshape-mate-types?page=3 You can also look at the icons in Onshape itself. They show you the degrees of motion that the mate allows. The fasten mate restricts all movement and so its icon has no arrows. The revolute mate allows rotational motion only. Its icon reflects this. Some mates will have limits, or degree values, which allow you to restrict its motion further. These are located in the menus of their respective mates. Others may allow you to change the axis of the mate and flip it around or offset its position. You can suppress mates just like you can hide sketches by right clicking on the mate in the left menu. These will cancel their function in the document until you unsuppress them. This is also where you can isolate them or make them transparent. Degrees of Freedom \u00b6 Mates control the degrees of freedom of your part. Every object has 6 degrees of freedom, rotational (around an axis) and translational (up, down, left, right) in each of the three planes (top, left/right, front). It\u2019s difficult to keep track of which degrees/what motion a mate limits, I\u2019d recommend just looking at the mate icons to discern which degrees/what motion a mate allows instead. View Video Lesson: (Mate Connectors, All Mates, Joint Limits) Tip When, working with many parts, it can sometimes be difficult to select a specific part you need. Fortunately, you can right click on objects in the environment (or part itself on the left tab) and make them transparent, hide, or isolate them!

Onshape provides users with a list of mates, along with mate connectors, which allow you to define custom mating points. View Document: Brief Overview Of Mating Mating is the connection of separate parts (part studios) together to form one cohesive piece or model of a product. Mating on Onshape must be done in the Assembly tab. Mating is done through the use of Mate Connectors. These are little circle icons that appear when you select a mate option in an assembly. Select two mate connectors while inside a mate menu and they will mate together. Onshape automatically selects common mating positions for objects and creates mate connectors on them for your convenience, but if you want to attach an object to a place where there is no predefined mate connector, you can select the mate connector option and create your own. Mates work by defining and restricting the degrees of freedom of an object. To find out specifics about each mate, access the document below. https://learn.onshape.com/learn/course/fundamentals-onshape-assemblies/mating-assembly-components/onshape-mate-types?page=3 You can also look at the icons in Onshape itself. They show you the degrees of motion that the mate allows. The fasten mate restricts all movement and so its icon has no arrows. The revolute mate allows rotational motion only. Its icon reflects this. Some mates will have limits, or degree values, which allow you to restrict its motion further. These are located in the menus of their respective mates. Others may allow you to change the axis of the mate and flip it around or offset its position. You can suppress mates just like you can hide sketches by right clicking on the mate in the left menu. These will cancel their function in the document until you unsuppress them. This is also where you can isolate them or make them transparent.","title":"Mating"},{"location":"onshape/navigating-assemblies/#degrees-of-freedom","text":"Mates control the degrees of freedom of your part. Every object has 6 degrees of freedom, rotational (around an axis) and translational (up, down, left, right) in each of the three planes (top, left/right, front). It\u2019s difficult to keep track of which degrees/what motion a mate limits, I\u2019d recommend just looking at the mate icons to discern which degrees/what motion a mate allows instead. View Video Lesson: (Mate Connectors, All Mates, Joint Limits) Tip When, working with many parts, it can sometimes be difficult to select a specific part you need.

Let\u2019s start working on creating sketches. View Video Lesson: Sketching and Constraining Basics Constraining Objects \u00b6 An important concept in any CAD software, not just Onshape, is constraining . Constraining is the process of limiting or restricting the entities in your sketch. To constrain a sketch follow the Size, Location, Orientation process . Any type of sketch will need to fulfill these three conditions to be defined. Size: This is a measurement of the entity itself. Location: This defines the entity\u2019s position in 3D space. Orientation: This is the \u201cdirection\u201d that an entity is in. Relations provide ways to quickly define a sketch entity\u2019s size, location, and orientation. Understanding them will help you create more detailed sketches and troubleshoot errors quickly. View Video Lesson: Relations Reading Sketches \u00b6 It\u2019s also important to be able to understand diagrams of 3D models. Interpreting sketches can vary depending on the type of sketch, but there are certain symbols you will tend to see across the majority of drawings. For the most part, all the information about a model can be found from its diagram, but sometimes dimensions/relations will need to be inferred. The resources below list some of the more common symbols found in diagrams. Now let's look at the relations we can infer from this diagram. Other Sketching Features and Troubleshooting \u00b6 There\u2019re a number of other sketch features in Onshape that allow you to simplify your work and decrease clutter in your sketches. View Video Lesson: Construction Lines, Patterning, Mirroring If at any point your sketch becomes too cluttered, you can always right click on sketches in your features tab (left side) and suppress it. This will make the entity invisible until you right click on the tab again and unsuppress it. Troubleshooting Sketches \u00b6 Two common issues encountered while sketching are red entities which occur when an entity is over defined... Overdefined Sketch This entity has conflicting constraints. It has been defined as having both a 2 and 4 inch radius. ...and blue entities, which occur when an entity is under defined. Underdefined Sketch This entity must be further constrained. It lacks both a side and bottom measurement. Here\u2019re some tips for troubleshooting: Examine the sketch and look for errors in constraining (dimensioning or relation) If the sketch\u2019s name in the sketch menu and features tab is red , hover over it and check the error message. If your entities are blue , pull on them and see which way they move. You may have broken an existing relation and may need to add new ones. Use the undo button or delete the entities and restart the portion of your sketch. Reload your webpage. Onshape can be buggy sometimes.

This is an intro to our robot structure, so we won't go into specifics on how to actually write the code until the next section. Gradle \u00b6 When creating a robot project, Gradle will automatically generate the files build.gradle , gradle/ , gradlew , gradlew.bat , settings.gradle . You shouldn't ever need to touch these. Your IDE may also generate the folders bin/ , build/ , .wpilib/ , .vscode/ , and .idea/ . It's safe to ignore these files as well. vendordeps \u00b6 The vendordeps/ folder in our robot code contains .json files that identify third party libraries we use. You can read more about it here . src \u00b6 Just like any other Java project, the src/ directory holds all of our actual code. src/main/java/frc/robot/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 Constants.java \u251c\u2500\u2500 Main.java \u251c\u2500\u2500 Robot.java \u251c\u2500\u2500 RobotContainer.java \u251c\u2500\u2500 commands/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 ConveyorQueue.java \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 Drive.java \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 Shoot.java \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 VisionTrack.java \u2514\u2500\u2500 subsystems/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 Arm.java \u251c\u2500\u2500 Climber.java \u251c\u2500\u2500 Conveyor.java \u251c\u2500\u2500 Drivetrain.java \u251c\u2500\u2500 Intake.java \u2514\u2500\u2500 Shooter.java Main.java \u00b6 This file is autogenerated, and there is rarely any reason to touch this file at all. It contains the classic main method, which is run at startup and starts up the rest of the robot code. Robot.java \u00b6 This file is the control center of the robot. It has the methods that are called to run the robot. Documentation on each of the methods within it can be found here . Constants.java \u00b6 This file contains all the numbers that don't change and are relevant to the whole robot. This includes all ports and joystick buttons, which correlate to motor controllers, solenoids, and commands in the code. RobotContainer.java \u00b6 This is where we create and store the objects for the subsystems, and set up all the controller and joystick commands that the driver uses to operate the robot. It does not extend from any superclasses, and is mainly used as a way to separate code from Robot.java commands/ \u00b6 Commands are what run the robot. For example, there may be a RunIntake command that runs two motors to turn the wheels that intake a game piece. subsystems/ \u00b6 Subsystems are another name for robot mechanisms, such as a drivetrain, a shooter, an intake, or a climber. The subsystem classes contain the Objects for the motor controllers and solenoids and have methods for controlling the subsystem, which are used by commands. Deploying code to the robot \u00b6 Note Deploying code to the RoboRIO only works on a Windows computer; however, you can still build your code to see if it compiles correctly. Now that you've created a robot project, you may want to deploy your code to the robot. In order to do this you'll need a few things: A Windows computer with the driver station software installed A RoboRIO connected to an electronics board (radio optional) and a battery If you do not have the radio, have a USB-B cable handy to connect your computer to the RIO With the radio: Disconnect from your wifi network and connect to the radio's wifi network. Without the radio: Plug the computer into the RoboRIO using a USB-B cable. Now that you're connected, it's time to actually deploy your code. Follow the WPILib instructions to deploy your code to the robot. Writing robot code \u00b6 Now you know how to deploy your code. Let's learn how to interact with physical components of the robot. Javadocs \u00b6 Java has a standard documentation format that is autogenerated from documentation comments in the code. We will be referencing them extensively to write our code. On top of a Javadoc contains a description of the class, its package, what it inherits, and more. Below that is a section containing the class' constructors, and the section below contains the methods you can call from that class. If you click on any of the constructors or methods, you get directed to a section with more details about what you clicked. Here's a Javadoc of a class you should be familiar with: ArrayList . WPILib \u00b6 WPILib is the name of the library FRC provides us to control the robot with. Its JavaDocs are located here (and you can also find a link to them in the Resources page of this site). We will be mostly using the library's edu.wpi.first.wpilibj package, and you can search for a class or method using the search bar located in the top right corner of the javadocs page. Practice \u00b6 First has a pretty good write-up on command-based programming , so we'll read that. Once you're done, we'll practice writing some basic commands. Before you start If you have access to a robot and would like to test your code, you will need the following items: items from the previous section an Xbox controller a Talon SRX a brushless motor Ask your teammates in the electronics department for help :) If you are new to git, read the intro to git section before proceeding. Clone the TrainingRobot project , and open it in VSCode. You can check if you have got the right project open by deploying the project to the robot and pressing the X button on the controller. If the motor spins, you've got the right code! Note VSCode may prompt you to \"import project to 2020\". Don't do this. Warning Please don't actually push any of your changes to the Github repository. Part 1: Basic IO \u00b6 Let's change the button to trigger the command continuously while it's held rather than when it's pressed. In the TrainingRobot project, find the RobotContainer.java file ( src/main/java/frc/robot/RobotContainer.java ). Currently, line 51 contains the method whenPressed() . Refer to the WPILib Javadocs to determine what you need to change whenPressed() to in order to run the command while the button is pressed. Hint controller_X is an instance of the JoystickButton class. In the same project, you'll find the RunMotor.java file in the commands/ directory. In the RunMotor class, the end() method is currently empty. Add code to it that stops the motors. Hint You might want to write something similar to what's in execute() . Once you think you figured it out, follow the above Deploying robot code section again to deploy, and see if your code worked! Solutions RobotContainer.java private void bindIO () { controller_X . whileHeld ( new RunMotor ( motors )); } commands/RunMotor.java @Override public void end ( boolean interrupted ) { motors . run ( 0 ); } Part 2: Default commands \u00b6 Right now, our motor only has two states: half power, or completely off. Let's make the motor's speed correspond to more granular controller input using a joystick. Again in the RobotContainer.java file, modify the bindIO() method to set the default command of the Motors subsystem to the RunMotors command. Hint Get the joystick's Y-value from the XboxController we already have defined. Hint Motors is an implementation of the Subsystem interface. Pass the Motors subsystem into the command and have it drive the motors to the Y-value of the joystick when executed.

Problems can arise from all sorts of places, whether it be programming, electrical, mechanical, or a combination of them all. Like diagnosing a patient, you should find what's causing the symptoms (problems) to manifest themselves. Re-creating the issue can be helpful, espeically when the problem is programming related. Create a backup before making any changes, just in case something goes wrong. Establish a theory of probable cause. Once a problem has been identified, establish a ranked list of probable causes based on information gathered and your own technical knowledge. The way subteams are divided makes it essential to work together with others within and outside the programming subteam. Don't Tunnel Vision. It's easy to overlook the most elementary problems when working with complex systems. Test your theory to determine that actual cause. Go through the list of probable causes and test them to determine the true underlying issue. Issue a Fix. Develop and execute an appropriate fix to the issue. Verify functionality. Ensure the problem has been resolved and the system performs as designed. Side effects should be minimized. Implement measures to prevent the issue from happening again. Document the issue and process. Chances are the issue will pop up again. Documenting the process and issue allows others to quickly resolve the issue without frustration. This can save time during future troubleshooting and prevent others from taking the same missteps you may have taken. Tip Add your documented issues to the common issues page for others to reference.

Expected Capabilities \u00b6 Here are our expected capabilities for alliance robots during the playoffs. Our robot is designed around being a first pick. Ability Top 4 Alliance Captain First Pick Second Pick Climbing Climb power switch with leveling/even out capability/buddy climb Climb power switch and stay there Climb power switch and stay there Spin/Rotational Control Spin control panel with both positional and rotational control Spin control panel with rotational control Scoring Consistency Score high goal nearly every time Score high goal consistently Play defense or score on low goal Scoring Quantity Score three or more balls in high goal during autonomous period Score three balls in high goal during autonomous period Score on low goal during autonomous Number of Balls Stored Pick up and store five balls at a time Pick up and store five balls at a time Floor Intake Intake balls from the floor Intake balls from the floor Passable Through Trench Be able to go through the trench Preferably go through trench Tea3PO's Design \u00b6 Climbing Mechanism \u00b6 The climbing mechanism is a top priority for our robot. The endgame climb is the highest single-action scoring opportunity in a match. To get the endgame ranking point , each alliance needs a minimum of two robots hanging on the shield generator. No Control Panel Mechanism \u00b6 A spinner mechanism for the Control Panel was of low priority only beneficial for gaining RP, which isn\u2019t important in playoffs. focused more on designing the shooter High Goal Shooter \u00b6 We chose to design a shooter mechanism that could score high-goal as quickly as possible. Rule G11 in Section 7.2.3 of the 2020 game manual states that any robot within it\u2019s target scoring zone is protected from other robots . Because of this rule we decided to create a shooter optimized for shooting within the target zone . One of our prototype shooters Autonomous Shooting \u00b6 We decided that it was extremely valuable to take advantage of the autonomous double point scoring period . At the start of each match, each robot can hold up to three balls. Ground Intake \u00b6 Initially, we put a ground intake as a lower priority, but later in the season it was determined that a ground intake gave us significant strategic advantages. would allow us to intake balls anywhere on the field. Mechanisms of the Robot \u00b6 Drivetrain \u00b6 Chassis and Wheel \u00b6 The robot has a 31\" x 28\" West Coast drive base with six 6\" VEXpro traction wheels. 6\" wheels give us sufficient ground clearance over the 1\" metal tubes in the rendezvous point We added a 1/16\" center drop to decrease the skid in our front and back wheels to allow for smoother pivoting . To reduce the distance that the power cells have to travel while maintaining chassis stability, we cut a 7\" section on our front rail that allows for power cells to pass into the robot. The cut allows for power cells to be taken into the robot while still maintaining contact with either the ground intake and conveyor belt at all times without having an open chassis (shown below). Unlike closed chassis bots, open chassis bots do not require a ball to be raised above the front chassis frame . Drive Gearboxes \u00b6 Each side of the drivetrain is driven by a WCP SS gearbox with two falcon 550 motors geared at a 10.42-1 ratio . This helps achieve the robot\u2019s max speed of around 13 ft/s . Shooter \u00b6 Prototypes \u00b6 We had two main prototypes: a hooded shooter and a linear shooter . The linear shooter used two wheels on each side, and created relatively consistent and accurate shots. The hooded shooter also resulted in similar results. Both proved to have enough power to achieve the goals that we had set. We decided to go with the hooded shooter , as the hood increased the number of contact points between the mechanism and the power cell. We were concerned that any variation on the power cells, such as a tear or hole in the power cell, could drastically decrease the accuracy of our shots. Final Design \u00b6 The final shooter design consists of... two \u00bc\" thick polycarbonate rails with arcs 3D printed hood attaches to the rails to control the release angle and follow the contour of the shooter wheel a 3lb Neoprene drive roller (shooter wheel) driven by 2 NEO motors at a 1:1 ratio Shooting Demonstration Accumulator \u00b6 Prototypes \u00b6 Hopper vs Conveyor vs Ramp The Ramp \u00b6 We tested a shallow, gravity driven ramp , but decided that the speed at which the power cells feed into the shooter would be slower than we wanted . The Hopper \u00b6 Concerns about the hopper\u2019s potential to jam balls led to the conveyor being chosen over it. The Conveyor (Chosen!) \u00b6 We built a wooden prototype of the conveyor, but found that the single NEO brushless motor wasn\u2019t powerful enough to move the power cells through the system, so we settled for a two motor system. Final Design: Conveyor \u00b6 The final design is a conveyor that files power cells one by one. The conveyor is broken into two separate sections and has an \"L\" shape . Each section has a single NEO motor geared similarly to the shooter to minimize energy transfer between the shooter and the balls. For the horizontal section, brushes are placed inside the conveyor. The conveyor is capable of holding five power cells and accelerating to full speed, allowing all five power cells to exit the conveyor quickly. These push balls towards the rear and prevent jamming . The vertical section consists of a single conveyor with 0.5in compression to move the balls upward into the shooter wheel. This section automatically stores two balls vertically. Two photoelectric sensors are located at the top and bottom The bottom sensor detects balls and tells the conveyor to run and push balls up one at a time. The top sensor is used to keep space between stored balls and shooter wheel Ground Intake \u00b6 Prototypes \u00b6 To find the types of the wheels, height of the intake , and distance of the intake from the bumpers , we drove a hex shaft with a drill , varying the wheels and relative distances until we found the combination that would allow the power cells to be rolled up into the chassis. We realized that because the intake is only actuated by a motor on one side , the other side would not follow and retract into the robot, resulting in one side sinking down, or an asymmetrical intake . We solved this issue with a set of inner intake arms , connected by a churro shaft. We also found that the power cells were jamming between the intake and the conveyor . We added driven brushes to the churro support of our intake to help guide the power cells smoothly into the conveyor. Intake Demonstration Final Design \u00b6 The final ground intake has\u2026 Ten 3\" mecanum wheels on the intake and one center omni wheel , which center the power cells when they contact the intake. One pair of inner and one pair of outer polycarbonate arms , which support the hex shaft running across the front of the robot. The retraction is driven by a BAG motor and the spinning of the intake wheels is powered by a 775pro . Poly Cord belts run from the driven thunderhex shaft to the churro support, driving pulleys that spin the intake brushes. Climber \u00b6 Prototypes \u00b6 Telescoping Cascade vs 4-Bar Arm vs One Point Pivot The Telescoping Cascade The telescoping cascade was prototyped out of PVC and thin cable. It worked well, but would require us to either sacrifice not being able to fit under the trench , or build at least four stages to reach our target height. The 4-Bar Arm The 4-Bar Arm also worked effectively, but was eliminated for its complexity. The One Point Pivot (Chosen!) The team settled on the one point pivot arm because it was simple allowed us to reach our desired height achievable by our team Final Design \u00b6 Our final design is a one point pivoting climb with\u2026 Two vertical support bars , which are mounted at the front of the robot, with two aluminum 1x1 tubes on each side to act as arms. The arms are controlled by two 775pro motors , one for each arm. Two polycarbonate hooks for extra reach and to attach to the climbing bar. The hooks are 22\" long, and made of \u00bc\" thick polycarbonate. 3D printed bearing carriages allow the hooks to slide up and down the climber arms To Extend the Arm Gas shocks extend the climber arm upwards, and a constant force spring pulls the hooks up. A winch rope (paracord) holds the arms down, and when the motors actuate, allowing the winch rope to release, both the climber hooks and the arms are raised and the rope is unwound. If needed, bearing carriages will slide the hooks up and down the climber arms. To Retract the Arm At the start of the round, rope connecting the hooks and the motor is wound up in one direction. When we want to retract the arm, the motor continues to drive in the same direction, and the winch rope continues turning (in the same direction) and winds itself up again , allowing the arms to both extend out and retract back.
